# NCHRP 08-145: Ramp metering Code Package Documentation

This folder contains the source code for ramp metering for the NCHRP 08-145 Project: Utilizing Cooperative Automated Transportation (CAT) Data for Freeway Operational Strategies. A detailed description of the methodologies can be found in the project final report. The source code contains the main file (run.py) that runs the traffic simulation of Interstate 210 (I-210), with two traffic accidents, under the localized ramp metering algorithm ALINEA

# Project Description

This folder contains the source codes 1) running the simulation of I-210 (from postmile 28 to postmile 38), with two traffic accidents, under the localized ramp metering algorithm ALINEA and 2) saving the results.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 (or higher)

Python Package Requirements:
- numpy==1.19.5
- pandas == 1.1.5
- freewayControl
- traci==1.14.1
- sumolib==1.14.1

# Usage
Before running the simualtion, make sure that the following files/directoris exist:

- a simulation project directory containing necessary files, such as main simulation file ending with sumocfg.xml, route file, network file and so on;
- a list of json files of sensor description including senosr IDs and period; 
- a json file of of meter description including phase IDs, green time, minimum red time, maximum red time and so on;
- the python package freewayControl.py.

To start the simulation, run the following script:
```
python run.py
```
